# 🦠 COVID-19 India Stats Dashboard (Streamlit App)

This is a simple and interactive COVID-19 dashboard built using **Streamlit**. It shows state-wise COVID-19 stats in India, allows the user to select the **month** (demo), choose states, and view **age-wise case distribution** (dummy data).

> ⚠️ Note: This app uses the [Rootnet India COVID-19 API](https://api.rootnet.in/) which provides the **latest snapshot** of COVID-19 stats — not historical data.
